    Async implementation for requests (using httpx). Performs a GET request on the specified URL.

    Behavior:
    ---------
    - Works asynchronously using asyncio.Semaphore for limiting max outbound requests.
    - Semaphore blocks until a thread calls release().
    - Uses httpx.Limits to avoid OOM and 100k requests under load.
    - Timeout of 5s is used as to not wait for long periods of time.

    Args:
    -----
    - client - httpx.AsyncClient, an asynchronous HTTP client with connection pooling, HTTP/2, redirects, cookie persistence, etc.
    - url - The url to perform a GET request on.

    Raises:
    -------
    - RepoFileFetchError
