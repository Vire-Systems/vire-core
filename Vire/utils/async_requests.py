    Async implementation for requests (using httpx). Performs a GET request on the specified URL.
    
    Behavior -
        Works asynchronously using asyncio.Semaphore for limiting max outbound requests. Semaphore blocks until a thread calls release().
        Uses httpx.Limits to avoid OOM and 100k requests under load (...).
        Timeout of 3s is used as to not wait for long periods of time.
    
    Args -
        client - httpx.AsyncClient, an asynchronous HTTP client with connection pooling, HTTP/2, redirects, cookie persistence, etc.
        url - The url to perform a GET request on.
