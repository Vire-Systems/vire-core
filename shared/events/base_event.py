class VireBaseEvent:
    """
    Base event contract for all events emitted within Vire.

    Every event, including ErrorEvent, must inherit from this class.
    The event handler expects an instance of this contract to process
    logging, state propagation, and external communication.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    - event (str): Name of the event being emitted.

    - job_uuid (str): UUID of the associated build job.

    - user_uuid (str): UUID of the user associated with the build job.

    - diag_code (str): Diagnostic reference code associated with the event.

    - severity (Severity): Severity level used for logging and external propagation.

    - summary (str): One-line summary describing what occurred. Used for internal logs and user-facing reports.

    - write_log (bool): Whether this event should be written to the internal logger.

    - propagate_state (bool): Whether this event should be propagated to external systems.
        - This may include updating PostgreSQL, publishing through Redis, or notifying supported integrations.

    - timestamp (datetime): UTC timestamp representing when the event was created.
