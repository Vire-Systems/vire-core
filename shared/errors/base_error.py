class VireBaseError(Exception):
    """
    Base class for all Vire-specific exceptions.

    Every exception raised by Vire should inherit from this class. It provides
    a standardized structure for propagating error information throughout the
    system while allowing centralized handling for logging, database updates,
    and user-facing responses.

    Instances of this class are intended to carry metadata only. They do not
    perform logging or persistence themselves; that responsibility belongs to
    the centralized event handler.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    - error_code: Stable identifier used by the logging system and databases.

    - error_title: Short, human-readable title describing the error. Intended for the user.

    - severity: Logging severity associated with the exception.

    Optional Attributes:
    ---------
    These are sent to the User Report.

    1. possible_causes
    2. possible_fixes
    3. notes (suggestions to the user)
